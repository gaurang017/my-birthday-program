      My Dearest Aditi,<br><br>
      I want to tell you something I've never shared with you before. I struggle every day to message you because of the restrictions set by my guardians. But despite this, my love for you has only grown stronger. Every secret text, every word I write, is filled with all my love for you.<br><br>
      You are my world, and no matter how hard it gets, I will always find a way to stay connected with you. You mean everything to me.<br><br>
      Forever yours,<br>Gaurang ðŸ’–
