      My Dearest Aditi,<br><br>
      I cannot express enough how much you mean to me. Every day, you bring happiness to my heart. You fill my world with warmth and light, and I am endlessly grateful to have you in my life. 💖<br><br>
      Though we are separated by distance, my love for you grows stronger every single day. The thought of you makes my heart race, and I feel so fortunate to call you mine. 💫

      Every photo you share with me feels like I'm seeing you right there with me, and every moment we talk feels like I'm right next to you. I treasure these moments more than words can explain.<br><br>
      My love, you are always in my thoughts, and every time I hear your voice or see your smile, I feel like I'm the luckiest person in the world to have someone as wonderful as you by my side. 🌹

      Even though we face obstacles that try to keep us apart, know that nothing will ever break the bond we share. I will keep fighting for us, no matter the distance or the struggles we face. Every challenge is just another step closer to the love we will build for the rest of our lives.<br><br>
      My love for you is limitless. There’s not a single moment where I don't think of you and wish to be with you. 💖

      You have given me a reason to smile every day, and even when times are tough, I know I can get through anything because I have you by my side, even if it’s just in spirit.<br><br>
      I cherish every moment we share, every word we exchange, and every gesture of love you show me. You are truly my everything. ❤️
